Ingredients
16 ounces (450 g) bread cut into 1-inch pieces (day old bread if possible)
1 tablespoon oil
1 pound (500 g) sage pork sausage, or sweet or spicy Italian sausage, casings removed
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups finely chopped yellow or brown onions, from 1 large onion or 2 small onions
1 cup chopped celery, from 2-3 stalks
5 large cloves garlic, minced (or 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic)
1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh chopped sage
1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary
3/4 teaspoon sea salt or more to taste
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup dry white wine optional — (sub with 1/4 cup of broth)
3 cups low sodium chicken stock
1 egg lightly whisked
3/4 cup cranberries optional
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).

Place the bread cubes in a single layer on a sheet pan and bake for 7-10 minutes, or until dried and toasted. Transfer the bread cubes to a very large bowl.
Meanwhile, in a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Cook the sausages over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until browned and cooked through, breaking up the sausage with a fork while cooking. Add to the bread cubes.
In the same pan, melt the butter and add the onions, celery, garlic, parsley, sage, rosemary or thyme, salt and pepper. Saute over medium heat for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are softened. Add the wine (if using) and allow the wine to reduce down to half (about 4 minutes).

Take off the heat and mix in the stock to combine all of the flavours. Add the beaten egg and cranberries, and pour into the bread, mixing really well with a wooden spoon until all the liquid has been absorbed.

Pour the bread stuffing into a 9x12-inch baking dish. Bake for 30 minutes, until browned on top and hot in the middle. Serve warm and topped with crumbled bacon!
